### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a Ruby backend developer. On my free time I'm working on a video repository called Unframed. It is going to be a social platform for dancers!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: drop me an email to skaidrapat@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I dance Lindy Hop, Solo Jazz, and Contemporary. I am currently learning UK Jazz dance and plan to pick up Tap dance. I believe jazz is the happiest music to dance to :)
