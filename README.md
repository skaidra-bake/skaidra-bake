### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m a junior full-stack developer @Pixie Labs. On my free time I'm working on an image repository called Unframed. It is going to be a social platform for dancers!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Ruby, Rails, Rspec, and React. RRRRRRR 🐅
- 📫 How to reach me: drop me an email to skaidra@pixielabs.io / skaidrapat@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I dance Lindy Hop, Solo Jazz, and Contemporary. I am currently learning UK Jazz dance and plan to pick up Tap dance. I believe jazz is the happiest music to dance to!
