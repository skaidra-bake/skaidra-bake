### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an image repository called Unframed. It is going to be a website for dancers to upload their images and connect with each other!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Ruby, Rails, and Rspec. rrrrr :)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: drop me an email to skaidrapat@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I dance Lindy Hop, Solo Jazz, and Contemporary. I am currently learning UK Jazz dance and plan to pick up Tap dance. I believe jazz is the happiest music to dance to!
